# Contributing to Shadowrun Anarchy GPT

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project! While this repository is primarily maintained as a reference implementation for the Shadowrun Anarchy GPT assistant, we welcome contributions that improve the codebase or documentation.

## Important Note

This repository exists mainly to provide transparency about what's running in the GPT and to allow others to use or learn from the code. Active development and direct support are limited, but quality contributions are still appreciated.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Issues

- **Before submitting**: Check if the issue already exists
- **Be descriptive**: Include steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior
- **Include context**: OS, Node/Python versions, relevant logs
- **Be patient**: This is not actively supported, so responses may be delayed or absent
