# Support

## Important Notice

**This repository is primarily a reference implementation.** It exists to show what's inside the Shadowrun Anarchy GPT and to allow others to use or learn from the code. Direct support is limited.

## What This Means

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited Response Time**: Issues and questions may not receive timely responses
- üìö **Self-Service**: You're encouraged to explore the code and documentation independently
- ü§ù **Community Driven**: Other users may help, but don't expect guaranteed answers
- üîç **Transparency Focus**: The main goal is code visibility, not active maintenance

## Getting Help

### 1. Self-Help Resources (Recommended)

- **Code Documentation**: Read through the code comments and README files
- **Issue History**: Check closed issues for similar problems
- **Code Examples**: Study the implementation for understanding

### 2. Community Support

- **GitHub Issues**: You can open issues, but responses may be delayed or absent
- **Discussions**: Check if GitHub Discussions are enabled for community help
- **Pull Requests**: Well-documented PRs are more likely to be reviewed

### 3. What to Include When Asking for Help

If you do open an issue:

- **Environment**: OS, Node/Python version, relevant tools
- **Clear Description**: What you're trying to do and what's happening
- **Code Samples**: Minimal example that reproduces the issue
- **Research**: What you've already tried
- **Specific Question**: Avoid "it doesn't work" - be precise

## What We Can Help With (Maybe)

- Clear bugs in the reference implementation
- Documentation improvements
- Simple clarifications about the code

## What We Cannot Help With

- ‚ùå Custom implementations based on this code
- ‚ùå Integration with your specific projects
- ‚ùå General programming tutoring
- ‚ùå Debugging your modifications
- ‚ùå Feature requests for new functionality
- ‚ùå Questions about the OpenAI GPT platform itself

## Alternative Resources

### For Shadowrun Anarchy

- Official Shadowrun communities
- Tabletop RPG forums and subreddits
- Catalyst Game Labs resources

### For Technical Issues

- Stack Overflow for programming questions
- Official documentation for the languages/frameworks used
- Community forums for specific technologies

### For OpenAI GPT Development

- OpenAI documentation
- OpenAI community forums
- GPT development communities

## Contributing Instead of Asking

Consider contributing fixes or improvements instead of asking for help:

- Found a bug? Submit a PR with a fix
- Documentation unclear? Submit a PR with improvements
- Missing examples? Add them and submit a PR

## Response Expectations

- **Issue Response**: Days to weeks, possibly never
- **PR Review**: May take weeks or months
- **Bug Fixes**: Only critical issues may be addressed
- **Feature Requests**: Unlikely to be implemented

## Repository Purpose

Remember, this repository serves these purposes:

1. **Transparency**: Show what's in the GPT
2. **Reference**: Provide example implementations
3. **Learning**: Help others understand the approach
4. **Reuse**: Allow others to build upon the work

It is NOT intended as:

- A supported product
- A service with guaranteed uptime
- A tutoring resource
- A place for general Shadowrun or programming questions

Thank you for understanding the nature of this project!
